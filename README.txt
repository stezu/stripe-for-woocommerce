# Stripe for WooCommerce
Plugin version: 1.0

Requires at least:
- WordPress 3.8.0
- WooCommerce 2.1.0

## What is Stripe?
[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) allows you to take credit card payments on your site without having sensitive credit card information hit your servers. This works by having your customers input their credit card information on your web page which is then sent to Stripe's servers via JavaScript and a unique "token" is created which you can then use to charge your customers one time. This process keeps you from having to be [PCI compliant](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/), and allows you to quickly process credit card payments that makes your store look more legitimate than one that only supports PayPal.

## Why does this plugin exist?
In reality, there aren't a lot of methods you can use that provide PayPal-like convenience (and prices) for processing credit card payments directly on your site. Stripe is in the right neighborhood for developers and tech-savvy people but perhaps not for the layman, and this plugin hopes to fix that. In the Stripe interface, you have access to all kinds of information on charges, customers, and logs.

This plugin exists because the current solutions for Stripe on WooCommerce are incomplete or expensive. WooThemes made a [Stripe plugin](http://www.woothemes.com/products/stripe/) but at least according to their site it hasn't been updated since 2011 and it costs $79. [Striper](https://wordpress.org/plugins/striper/) is the plugin that I used to initally start this plugin process and while free, was lacking a few features that I thought were necessary.
